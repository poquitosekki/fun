# Statistical Inference

- Statistical inference has two different directions, application and construction directions.
- Both directions follow very different logics for building the statistical inference framework.
- Teaching statistical inference should use the logic of construction.

## Application direction

1. We have a sample with certain characteristics (n,xbar,s). 
2. This sample of size n is drawn randomly from a population of size N.
TODO: Complete it

## Construction direction

1. We are interested in the age of a  population of size N with a mean Mu. The population follows a distribution
2. One can take many random samples of size n from this population C(N,n).
3. If we take all of these possible random samples and plot their distributions we can immediately see that they are different from each other and do not follow any particular pattern, but one normally would assume that they keep some of the population tendencies.
4. Each of these samples has their own mean value (xbar) and standard deviation (s) and thus each of them a different sample distribution. 
5. Now we collect the mean value of all the possible samples that we can draw from the population and plot them.
6. The sampling distribution (distribution of statistic xbar) is normal even if the population is not normaly distributed (this is due to the Central Limit Theorem CLT).
